# Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis in E-commerce using Machine Learning (CSRA Dashboard)

A complete end-to-end data science + ML project that analyzes customer behavior in an e-commerce dataset, builds churn/retention prediction models (session-level + customer-level), performs segmentation (RFM + KMeans), and deploys an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for analytics, prediction, and recommendations.

### What each folder means
- **`data/`**: Raw dataset used by the Streamlit app and notebooks.
- **`models/`**: Trained ML models serialized as `.pkl` (CatBoost/XGBoost/Sklearn pipeline objects).
- **`notebooks/`**: Research notebooks used for EDA, feature engineering, training, analysis, and recommendations.
- **`reports/`**: Saved results used by the Streamlit app (metrics, feature schema, feature importance, and other exports).

## App Pipeline (End-to-End)

### 1) Data Loading
The app reads raw data from:

- `data/Ecommerce.csv`

In `app.py`, the data is loaded and lightly standardized:
- parse `visit_date` (if present)
- map `marketing_channel` numeric codes to readable names (if present)

### 2) Optional Processed Dataset
The app supports an optional processed dataset (feature table), if present:

- `data/processed/customer_features_phase1.csv` *(optional)*

If it’s missing, the dashboard still runs, but some advanced evaluation features (like churn label analysis) may be limited.

### 3) Model Loading
Models are loaded from:

- `models/*.pkl`

The sidebar lets you choose:
- upload a `.pkl` model (optional)
- or select from saved models in the repository

The app infers whether the model is:
- **session-level**
- **customer-level**
based on the model name (`session` / `customer` keywords).

### 4) Feature Schema Alignment
To avoid column mismatch, the app uses:

- `reports/feature_cols.json`

It stores a schema such as:
- `session_level_features`
- `customer_level_features`

During prediction:
- missing features are created and set to 0
- columns are reordered to exactly match expected feature order

### 5) Predictions
For a selected model:
- `predict()` is used for labels
- probability is derived from:
  - `predict_proba()` if available
  - else `decision_function()` (converted using sigmoid)
  - else fallback to predicted class as probability

Predictions are converted into:
- **risk band**: Low / Watch / Medium / High
- **recommended action**: reminder / coupon / VIP call, etc.

### 6) Business Analytics + Visualization
The app computes and visualizes:
- revenue by category
- conversion by channel
- cart abandonment
- segmentation plot (RFM clusters)
- top risk customers with revenue-at-risk proxy
- recommendations based on purchase popularity

Your Streamlit app includes these pages:
- **Overview**: executive KPIs + revenue by category + recent rows
- **Research Summary**: best model selection, threshold sweep, ROC-AUC, error analysis, ablation study
- **Predict (Single)**: interactively edit key fields and predict churn probability
- **Batch Prediction**: upload CSV → get predictions + download results
- **Prediction History**: view all saved predictions (note: not persistent on Streamlit Cloud)
- **Model Comparison**: compare model metrics and view feature importance
- **Risk Ranking**: prioritize customers by churn probability / revenue-at-risk
- **Recommendations**: recommend categories/products based on history + popularity
- **Marketing Insights**: conversion + abandonment by channel
- **Cart Analysis**: cart abandonment breakdowns
- **Segmentation**: RFM + KMeans cluster visualization
- **Data Quality**: missing values + datatypes
- **Final Verdict**: selects best model based on F1
- **Explainability**: feature importance + business interpretation

## How to Run Locally

### 1) Create an environment (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2) Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3) Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Model Notes (CatBoost / XGBoost)
This repo contains `.pkl` models in `models/`. Since you mentioned CatBoost/XGBoost were used:

- Make sure `requirements.txt` contains:
  - `catboost`
  - `xgboost`

If you ever see errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: catboost` on Streamlit Cloud, it means the dependency was not installed and must be added to `requirements.txt`.

---

## Data Notes
- The application **requires**: `data/Ecommerce.csv`
- On Linux (Streamlit Cloud), filenames are **case-sensitive**.
  - Keep the exact casing consistent with `app.py` (currently `Ecommerce.csv`).

---

## Limitations / Known Deployment Behavior
### Prediction History Persistence
The app writes history to a local file:
- `data/prediction_history.csv`

On Streamlit Community Cloud, local file writes are **not reliably persistent** across restarts/redeploys.
If you need persistence, replace history storage with:
- SQLite (sometimes works but still risky on Cloud)
- Google Sheets
- Supabase / Firebase / PostgreSQL
- S3 / GCS object storage

---

## Future Improvements (Suggested)
- Add SHAP / LIME explainability for model outputs
- Add model versioning and metadata (training date, dataset version, features hash)
- Replace local file history with a persistent DB
- Add CI checks (linting, basic unit tests, data schema validation)
- Add dataset provenance + data dictionary
